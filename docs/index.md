## Official Media Bias/Fact Check Extension

Be informed as you read your Facebook feed. Media Bias/Fact Check is the most comprehensive media bias resource on the internet. There are currently 2500+ media sources listed in our database and growing every day. Don’t be fooled by Fake News sources.

We help you stay informed in 3 ways:

- Facebook: As you read your Facebook feed, we annotate news sources to show the reporting bias (Left, Right, Satire, Questionable, etc), as well as the quality of the reporting (Very High to Low/Fake). Additionally, we show the site Popularity: Of the 2500+ MBFC sites, this indicates where this site falls in the continuum of sites analyzed. Sites with few incoming links (i.e. very low traffic/reliability) are close to 0% in popularity. Sites with 3M incoming links are at 100%. This percentage should help you determine how seriously to take the site. Additionally, you can instruct the extension to "collapse" news sections so they don't appear in your feed. We recommend collapsing Left, Right, Questionable and sites with low/mixed factual reporting.

- Toolbar Icon: When you browse to a news site, the extension icon changes to the prefix of the bias L (Left), LC (Left-Center), PS (Pro-Science), etc, as well as changing to a descriptive color (Blue for left bias, Red for right bias, Yellow for questionable sources, etc). Additionally, if you have selected to collapse a section, the icon will flash to draw your attention to the site and make you aware of its bias/reporting.

- Twitter: In a limited fashion, we also annotate the main twitter.com feed with the bias/reporting for tweets. However, this is much less effective than Facebook simply due to the nature of Twitter.
