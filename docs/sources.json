The ACLU in their blog section and even news section often cite to places like the Huffington Post for news articles but sometimes they will use basic reporting like AP or Reuters. Beyond their news and blog posts most of the site covers issues that are often considered more liberal causes but most often it is consistent with their stance on the rights they champion. The ACLU has defended the KKK, Pro Abortion, and Neo-Nazi’s right to assemble and protest (1 2 3).  They will often be accused of being left biased as they do not advocate for gun rights, however they equally do not champion gun regulations either.  A quick search for Gun Rights or even Guns will yield no results or results only related to search and seizure cases they have taken on.  They do not agree on the individuals rights to own firearms but do not advocate on their beliefs.  They have teamed up with the NRA several times in a sort of odd fellowship (4). Their Blog & News feed’s can often be filled with more left leaning stances, but they are not biased in their case work load or defending the rights they advocate for. There have been times Justice Scalia the most outspoken and most conservative justice at the time had ideas that line up with the ACLU (5). Most modern conservatives may often take issue with much of what the ACLU advocates and litigates in courts. However, the ACLU has defended religious freedoms in the school as well. Including the right to pray in school (6). I would try to advocate that the ACLU is more neutral than left, but with the major shift in American politics to the right, I can no longer advocate that stance. (M.
